**Overview:** 
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market using Pandas in Python. It investigates the growth of the EV industry, top manufacturers, sales trends across years, and public charging infrastructure across various states in India. Additionally, the project includes assumptions about the environmental impact of EV adoption and discusses the importance of public charging stations in supporting the transition to sustainable transportation.




## Features

- **EV Manufacturer Ranking:** Identifies top 10 EV manufacturers based on sales over the years.
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Displays the sales trends from 2015 to 2024, including year-over-year growth.
- **State-wise Public Charging Stations:** Lists the top states with the highest number of public charging stations, helping understand regional infrastructure readiness.
- **Environmental Impact Considerations:** Analyzes the potential environmental benefits of switching to electric vehicles.




## Technologies Used
- **Pandas:** For Data Manipulation and Analysis
- **Power BI:** To Visualize and Draw Insights from Data



## Steps Followed
- Dataset importing
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    - Handling missing Values
    - Checking outliers
- Selecting Series or Dataframe Subset for Analysis
- Exporting required dataframes to csv files for further analysis using Power BI

## Results/Assumptions
- **EV Trend Analysis:**
    Continuous increase in EV sales. There was a drop in EV sales on 2020, because of covid-19 situation.
- **Manufacturer Performance:**
    Ola electric is having highest sales every year since 2022 (the year after it started manufacturing EVs).
- **Geographical Analysis:**
    Maharastra has the highest no.of ev manufacturing plants and public charging stations installed.
- **Government Impact:**
    Making the EVs at affordable prices, and few policies where even lower-middle-class people can buy EVs are few examples of 'Impact of Government Policies' on EV sales and EV awareness spread
- **Environmental Impact:**
    As we know the air pollution and release of greenhouse gases are mostly because of fuel vehicles, reducing the usage of fuel vehicles and adoptation to EVs leads to reduce in greenhouse gases emission, and reduces global warming, the major environmental concern
